# AgileXRM Concepts

## What is AgileXRM

**AgileXRM** is an integration with and embedding of **Agilepoint NX** into **Microsoft Dynamics 365**.

**AgileXRM** allows users of Dynamics 365 to create powerful process-centric applications
within Dynamics 365 that extend beyond out-of-the-box functionality to cater for
more business requirements in an easier more manageable way.

With **AgileXRM** you can:

- Visually model end-to-end business processes using AgilePoint Envision
- Visually monitor the execution of business processes in the organization
- Extend business processes beyond Dynamics 365 for easy integration with other systems
- Involve non-Dynamics 365 users, inside or outside the organization, to participate in business processes
- Measure and improve efficiency by controlling the performance of business processes
- Adapt to change with agility enabling business Users to respond to changing requirements

**AgileXRM** allows companies to build line-of-business
applications rapidly within Microsoft Dynamics 365.
Dynamics 365’s out-of-the-box functionality provides
reasonable workflow and forms capabilities, enabling
certain process automation. But managing real-world
business processes with this limited functionality
is impractical.AgileXRM brings true BPM functionality
to the Dynamics 365 platform.

### AgileDialogs
- Contact-center grade Dialogs.
- Standalone or embeddable in Dynamics 365/CRM or Custom portal
- Dynamic UI guided by process models
- Create and deploy with no compilation
- Consume business data in and out of different systems: integrate seamlessly with Dynamics 365/CRM
- Support for Unified Service Desk (USD)
- Full track history and versioning
- Comprehensive Dialogs
  - Dialog Page steps: for user interaction

- Session Persistence
  - Sessions can be transferred to another user
  - Session can resume after unexpected errors -e.g. if the browser closes unexpectedly, the session resumes in the same point when the browser reopens. 
- Rich Set of Controls 
  - Text, Password, Date Time, File Upload, Tip-Help controls
  - Validation associated to control, Conditional Behavior
  - Custom UI controls to extend the way data is captured and/or presented
  - Custom UI Logic using Built-In API
- Flexible Selection of Dynamic Data
  - OptionSet & Dynamic Filtered LookUps
  - Single & Multiple selection, Drop-down, Radio button, Check-boxes, Data Grid, List, LookUp List
- Flow Control
  - Elements in the Flow include: Single Condition, Multiple Condition, Nested SubDialogs 
- Synchronous & Asynchronous External System Calls
- Theming & Branding

### Process Manager

- Real-Time Visual Tracking of process execution 
  - Who has done which tasks
  - How long each activity takes to complete
  - What path the process has taken
  - See status of each task
  - View/Change process data
  - Navigate in the process hierarchy
 

- Control Flow: when required, it is possible to jump back or forth within a process instance, stop and resume it, and always maintaining full traceability.  
- In-flight process migration: AgileXRM can run multiple versions of the same process at the same time and Process Manager can migrate a running process instance, or a selection of instances, from one version to another. 
- Process Manager can run standalone or embeded within Dynamics 365/CRM and gives full process control to the user, assuming the necessary permissions are granted

### AgileMonitor: Reporting & Monitoring

A perfect companion to complement the powerful **Microsoft Dynamics 365/CRM** reporting and analysis tools.

**AgileMonitor** provides Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) analysis to make decisions on the running processes in real-time. It allows the user to filter and select with ample criteria and define data points for further analysis and take action upon it.

> e.g. How many complaints have not been answered within our  SLA, Overdue deliveries in course, User group with the most workload etc.

The result of each report is a representation of the process model that a power user can interact with.

> e.g. Reassign tasks, Change due dates, Send alerts to appropriate participants, Skip tasks, Cancel activities, etc.  

Some functionality includes: 
- Graphical Business Process Monitoring
- Metadata-based dynamic filtering
- Dynamics 365/CRM Security Role based data visibility
- Real-Time process status monitoring
- Allows superimposing any process data and aggregates on the model
- SLA-type on-demand reporting
- Drill down to process instance and real-time process management
- Directly from the model, the user can take actions on the process flow (i.e. reassign, roll-back, jump forward etc.)

### AgilePoint NX

**AgileXRM** is built on **AgilePoint NX** that provides full integration with all its capabilities.

**AgilePoint NX** is a cloud-based, digital-transformation
platform that combines the speed and agility of general
-purpose Low-Code with enterprise-class BPMS.
AgilePoint NX empowers citizen developers to build
almost any kind of custom app, from simple to
complex, without writing code.
