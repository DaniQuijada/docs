### StatusStateValue property

This is the value of the *Status Reason* to be used. 

If the *Status* property is set from the drop-down, 
then this property is filled automatically. If however, the *Status* property is set to a variable, 
then you can also use a **$\{variable\}** for this property, and it should resolve to a *Status Reason* value 
(not the display name – e.g. 2 instead of “Inactive”)
